# NORTHWIND-DB-Practice Repository

Welcome to the **NORTHWIND-DB-Practice** repository! This repository serves as a practice ground for working with the famous Northwind database. The Northwind database is a sample database that was originally created by Microsoft for educational and demonstration purposes. It simulates a fictional company's database, containing information about customers, orders, products, suppliers, and more.

In this repository, you will find a collection of scripts, queries, and exercises designed to help you improve your SQL skills by working with the Northwind database. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn SQL fundamentals or an experienced developer aiming to brush up on your skills, this repository has something for you.

## Repository Contents

The repository contains the following key components:

1. **Database Files**: You will find the necessary SQL script or database file to create and populate the Northwind database. This will serve as the foundation for your practice.

2. **SQL Queries**: A set of SQL query files that cover a range of topics and tasks. These queries are designed to help you practice retrieving, filtering, sorting, and manipulating data from the Northwind database.

3. **Exercises**: A series of exercises that gradually increase in complexity. These exercises are aimed at challenging your SQL skills and encouraging you to think critically about how to solve real-world data-related problems.

4. **Solutions**: Alongside each exercise, you will find solution files. These solutions provide one way to approach the exercises, but remember that there can be multiple ways to solve a problem in SQL.
